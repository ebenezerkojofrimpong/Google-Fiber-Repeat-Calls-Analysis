## Executive Summary
The objective of this project is to delve into the frequency of customers phoning customer support again after their initial inquiry. This analysis is crucial for leadership to gauge the team's effectiveness in resolving customer queries on the first interaction. Additionally, the project aims to uncover patterns in repeat calls, shedding light on why customers may need to call multiple times and identifying opportunities to enhance the overall customer experience. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive dashboard will be created, providing insightful visualizations on repeat caller trends.
